* If you use a Git-based workflow, edit the path in the seven 
* lines below to point to the folder that holds your VCQI repository.
*
* If you obtain VCQI by downloading a ZIP file from GitHub 
* or from TechNet-21, create a folder on your PC named
* C:/ado/VCQI/Current VCQI
* and unzip the VCQI folders there.
*
* Before you download an updated version, rename the old folder 
* from 'Current VCQI' to something like 'VCQI - 2017-05-24'
* and make a new folder named 'Current VCQI' and unzip the
* new folders and files there.
*
* Copy this file to your ado personal 
* folder and rename it 'profile.do'.
* 
* (If you don't know where your personal folder is, type the
* command "adopath" at the Stata command prompt.)
*
* If you already have a file named profile.do that contains
* some other Stata startup commands, simply edit that file
* and add these lines to the bottom of your program:
