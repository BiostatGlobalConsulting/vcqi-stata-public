{title:Description}

{pstd} {cmd:iwplot_svyp} is a program used to make inchworm plots for survey-estimated proportions. In order to run this program, you will need to install the iwplot_svyp package. {p_end}

{pstd} You may acquire the files from the Stata SSC Archive.  Type ssc install {cmd:iwplot_svyp} from the Stata command line or visit the {browse "http://biostatglobal.com":Biostat Global Consulting website} to find a link to a GitHub repository. {p_end}

{pstd} The {cmd:iwplot_svyp} program creates the inchworm plot and allows for the flexibility of using the options from the {help twoway} and {help graph} commands. Different options are specified through multiple datasets or noted in the syntax. {p_end}

{pstd} Only one dataset, known as the {help iwplot_svyp##inputdata:inputdata}, is required to run the {cmd:iwplot_svyp} program. The {help iwplot_svyp##inputdata:inputdata} set must contain all the required variables noted below. {p_end}

{pstd} You may generate the {help iwplot_svyp##inputdata:inputdata} dataset using Stata or specify the values in an Excel file and call the {helpb excel_wrapper_for_iwplot_svyp}. {p_end}
