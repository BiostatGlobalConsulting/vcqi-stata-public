{phang}
{bf:svypd} {hline 2} This command is a wrapper for Stata's {helpb svy proportion}
 command.{p_end}
 
{pmore2} It handles the special case where a variable encodes a binary outcome using 
 the values 0, 1, or missing.{p_end}
 
{pmore2} It estimates the proportion of the population represented by respondents coded 1.{p_end}

{pmore2} Its features include options to calculate not only the logit 
confidence interval (CI), but also modified Agresti-Coull, Anscombe, Fleiss (Wilson with continuity correction), Jeffreys, Wald and Wilson
CIs.{p_end}

{pmore2} For CI calculation, the user can specify whether or not to adjust for design degrees-of-freedom.{p_end}

{pmore2} The user can also specify that the design effect (DEFF) should be no smaller than 0.{p_end}

{pmore2} If the sample proportion is 0% or 100% and the user has requested Wald, Arcsine, Logit or Wilson intervals, the program ignores the complex sampling design and returns a Clopper-Pearson interval calculated using the full sample size (assumes the design effect is 1).{p_end}
 
{pmore2} It returns numerous outputs, described below.{p_end}

{title:Description}

{pstd}We commonly estimate the proportion of 1's in a svyset dataset variable
and want to capture the weighted proportion as well as the 95% CI
and the 90% CI and sometimes an arbitrary user-specified% CI using the 
level(##.##) option.{p_end}

{pstd}The svy: proportion command does not report a CI when the sample
proportion is 0 or 1; this command does.{p_end}

{pstd}The svy: proportion command doesn't allow values of the level()
option to fall between 0 and 10; this command does.{p_end}

{pstd}The svy: proportion command uses the logit method of estimating CIs.
This command also calculates the modified Wilson and modified Clopper-Pearson 
CIs, as suggested in Korn and Graubard ({help svypd##1998:1998}) for situations where the estimated 
proportion is near 0 or 1.{p_end}

{pstd}(Those are not unanimously endorsed, but are reasonable 
choices.) In particular, the modified Clopper-Pearson has been reviewed
by several authors and found to always be conservative in that it yields
wide intervals, but by golly they cover the true population prevalence 
100*(1-alpha/2)% of the time. Other more narrow intervals may cover 
it {it:on average} that often, but may not be guaranteed to cover it as 
reliably.{p_end}

{pstd}This program first checks to see if the sample proportion is 0 or 1, 
in which case it uses the (unmodified) Clopper-Pearson calculation for the 
CI, via Stata's cii command. (Because the ICC is arguably very near 0 if 
the proportion is 0 or 1; this is probably not a horrible idea.){p_end}

{pstd} To run this program, you will need to install the svypd package.{p_end}
